# Usage Instructions

## Basic Compilation of a Python Script

To compile a Python script into an optimized and protected executable:

1. **Launch the Application**: Run `python_binary_optimization_compiler.exe`.

2. **Select Your Python File**:

   - Click on the **Browse** button.
   - Navigate to your Python script (`.py` file) and select it.

3. **Start Compilation**:

   - Click on the **Start** button.
   - The application will begin compiling your script into an optimized and protected executable.

4. **Output**:

   - The optimized and protected executable will be saved in the `Native_Protected` directory within the application folder.
   - The output file will be a compiled `.pyc` file with enhanced protection.

## Compiling with Specified Compiler Options

Although the application automatically handles compiler settings, if you need to specify certain compiler options (e.g., for advanced optimization), please refer to the command-line version of the script or contact the Alpha Beta Network Research Team for assistance.

# Examples

An example of practical use has been created using this Windows application:

- **Project**: [Python Performance Benchmark Tool](https://github.com/alphabetanetcom/python-performance-benchmark-tool)
- **Executable**: The application was used to compile the benchmark tool, resulting in significant performance improvements.

**Features of the Example Executable**:

- Compiled using **Python Binary Optimization Compiler v1.3 GUI**.
- Achieved performance improvements of approximately 65% over standard Python execution.
- Demonstrates the application's capability to produce optimized and secure executables.

---

# Recommendations and Best Practices

- **Use Clean Source Code**: For successful compilation and optimization, use the original `.py` source code without prior obfuscation or encryption. Obfuscated or encrypted code may prevent the compiler from performing necessary optimizations.

- **Test Compiled Executables**: Thoroughly test the compiled executables to ensure they function as expected.

- **Stay Updated**: Keep the application updated to benefit from the latest optimizations and security features.

- **Combine with Other Protection Tools**: For maximum code security, consider combining this application with other Alpha Beta Network solutions like the [Python Obfuscator Online](http://obfuscator.alphabetanet.com/) and the [Secure Python Code Manager Script](https://github.com/alphabetanetcom/secure-python-code-manager).

- **Handle External Dependencies**: If your script uses external modules or packages, ensure they are compatible with Python 3.11.9 and include them appropriately.
